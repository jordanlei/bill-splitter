# Split Your Bill

Ever since websites like Splitwise have switched to paid / premium models, I've been convinced that there's gotta be a simpler way. So I built it! Split is a simple and easy-to-use bill splitting application that helps you divide expenses among friends and family. Whether you're dining out, traveling, or sharing household expenses, Split makes it easy to keep track of who owes what.

## Features

- **Unique group link:** Each group gets a unique link that can be shared with all members for easy access.
- **Editable items:** You can edit or delete any item or expense at any time to keep the records accurate.
- **Option to split remainder evenly or proportionally:** Choose to split the remainder of any bill evenly among all members or proportionally based on their shares.
- **Always free:** Our service is completely free to use, with no hidden charges or fees.

## How to Use

1. **Create a Group:** Start by creating a group. Give your group a name and add the names of all its members.
2. **Share the Link:** Once you create a group, share the unique link with all the members.
3. **Add Expenses and Payments:** You and other group members can add all the expenses and payments made by the group members. The expenses can be broken down into individual items (e.g., Dinner can be split into individual orders). Split will automatically calculate how much each member owes.
4. **Enjoy:** That's it! Split takes care of the calculations, so you can focus on enjoying your time.
